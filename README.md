## 🧠 About

While studying Finance & Investments, I realized many people — including those in professional finance roles — lacked access to accessible tools that encouraged good money habits. That inspired me to create **My Private Banker**: a budgeting and savings tracker designed to be personal, user-friendly, and built with real people in mind.

It was created in 2 weeks as a solo developer project and built from scratch — combining my background in finance with my growing skills in software engineering.
